Project Summary: 
    The provided Python script creates a basic voice-controlled virtual assistant named "Jarvis." It uses speech recognition and text-to-speech libraries to process user voice commands. The assistant can perform tasks like answering questions, telling the time, opening YouTube, telling jokes, playing songs, and more. The script listens for commands, responds with appropriate actions or messages, and includes an option to exit. This project serves as a simple introduction to voice-based interaction with a computer.
